Cough Audio Characteristic Visualization

This repository contains the work I completed during my internship at Salcit. The project focuses on visualizing the characteristics of cough audio data using Python libraries such as Librosa and Matplotlib. This helps in analyzing features like energy, spectral properties, and waveform markers.

Project Overview

The primary objective of this project is to provide insights into cough audio data by visualizing its characteristics. The visualizations include:

Waveform Visualization: Displaying the audio signal with time markers.

Spectrograms: Analyzing the spectral content over time.

Energy Graphs: Plotting the energy levels of the cough sounds.

Onset Detection: Identifying the start points of significant sound events.

Libraries Used

Librosa: For audio processing and feature extraction.

Matplotlib: For plotting graphs and visualizing data.

NumPy: For numerical operations.

Key Features

Waveform Visualization: Plots the waveform with start and end markers to interpret the audio signal.

Spectral Features: Spectrograms provide frequency content over time.

Energy Analysis: Visualizing energy fluctuations in cough data.

Onset Detection: Identifying the onset of sounds to understand patterns in cough occurrences.
